By default our app will be hosted at:

> http://localhost:3000

For this session, click on the _Dashboard_ tab and enter **3000** into the port.  
Click on **Display port** to see the default starter app.

If you were using your own version of Visual Studio Code, and you had created your react project on your machine, as soon as you start your development server it will open a new tab in your browser automatically.
