## Using Create-React-App

A quick way to start working with the React library is to use a starter project. This will have all the files and config you need to get started.

create-react-app is the starter project that is most popular especially for beginners.

## Wait for these commands to finish and your development server to start

What is actually being executed in the terminal?
npx create-react-app demo_app
npm start

When you want to start a react project you can run the command:

`npx create-react-app name-of-app`

where the name-of-app is anything you want.

Once React has finished installing we would open this folder in your IDE (eg VSCode)
Then to start your development server you would first make sure you were in the new project folder, then execute npm start.

```
cd name-of-app
npm start
```

Once your development server has started, open a new tab by clicking on the plus icon to see the default starting UI with create-react-app.

You can also open the VSCode tab to see what folders and files you have created.
